# MY NvChad Custom

This is my [NvChad](https://nvchad.com) customization based on [Minimal custom config](https://github.com/NvChad/example_config).
Please follow the instrucitons to setup NvChad and git clone this repository
under ./config/nvim/lua. Use my leader key which is ",". And the [which-key](https://github.com/folke/which-key.nvim)
panel will show all the mappings.
